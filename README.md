# CRAW reveal.js presentation template
reveal.js css template that meets the CRA-W graphical chart.

[Live demo](https://pokyah.github.io/AWS-Humain-comparison/reporting/Humain-presentation-revealjs.html#/) 

## How to use it ? 

Fork or clone this repository. It contains both the CSS and the background images for the title slide and the CRA-W footer.

These images are loaded to your presentation using ::after and ::before pseudo-elements.

Once loaded you need to specify the location of this folder into the (YAML) header of your .org or .Rmd doc. 

For .Rmd, have a look at the extensive documentation available on [Rstudio pages](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/revealjs_presentation_format.html#custom_css)
